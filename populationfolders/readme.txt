To create the files of data to populate the database with you need to run a
few scripts to create the files.
1. run the equipmentcreator.py
2. run the locationcreator.py
3. run the clientcreator.py
4. run the checkoutcreator.py

Now you need to move the created data text files to the directory where
you have your populate_rim.py file saved.
Run the populate_rim.py file and it will take a bit of time.
